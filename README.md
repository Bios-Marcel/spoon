# Spoon

A wrapper around `scoop`, aiming to be a full drop-in replacement, but still
relying on the existing community work in form of buckets.

## Highlighted Features

* More thorough `scoop search`
* Better performance (Varies from command to command)
* Additional features
  * Tab completion for commands, flags and packages
  * Common command aliases
    > For example no need to gues whether it's `uninstall`, `rm` or `remove`.
  * New commands
    * `spoon shell`, it's kinda like `nix-shell`
    * `spoon versions` to list all available manifests for an app (non
      autogenerated ones).

For a more detailed list of changes in comparison to scoop, check the table
below.

## Breaking Changes

* The `--global` flag hasn't beren implemented anywhere and I am not planning to
  do so as of now. If there's demand in the future, I will consider.

## Manual Installation

1. Add required buckets
  ```ps
  scoop bucket add extras
  scoop bucket add biosmarcel "https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/scoopbucket.git"
  ```
2. Install spoon
  ```ps
  scoop install spoon
  ```

**If you want to test out the latest "in progress" stuff, try the `spoon_pre`
package instead.** It contains potentially unstable or half-finished features.
Worst case it will install a package in an unfunctinal state, but won't cause
any harm to your OS or other packages.

## Updates

Note that self-updating is *NOT YET* possible. To update, please use `scoop
update spoon` for now.

## CLI Progress

Progress overview for scoop command implementations. This does NOT include spoon
native commands. It shows the current implementation status in terms of scoop
compatibility and highlights the differences.

There are basically three levels of implementations (and the states inbetween):
* Native
  > Fully reimplemented in spoon, no usage of scoop code
* Partially Native
  > Some functionallity is spoon native, but scoop code is still used
* Wrapper
  > Only provides autocompletion and documentation, but scoop code does 100% of
  > the execution work.

## Search

The search here does nothing fancy, it simply does an offline search of
buckets, just like what scoop does, but faster. Online search is not supported
as I deem it unnecessary. If you want to search the latest, simply run
`scoop update; spoon search <app>`.

The search command allows plain output and JSON output. This allows use with
tools such as `jq` or direct use in powershell via Powershells builtin
`ConvertFrom-Json`.
